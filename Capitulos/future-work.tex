The work described in this document is part of an ongoing research project and its purpose is mostly to describe the approach we intend to use during the research. That being said, the main research and implementation is yet to happen next semester. The following section presents the next planned steps and schedule for this research work:

\section{Activities Schedule}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finish work environment setup and firmware acquisition process.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expect to finish until the end of \textbf{June, 2021};
    \end{itemize}

    \item Enhance firmware extraction process.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expect to finish until mid \textbf{July, 2021};
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Setting up a toolchain building for kernel cross-compilation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expect to finish until the end of \textbf{July, 2021};
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Re-host firmware images using the compiled kernels and fix incompatibilities
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expect to finish until mid \textbf{September, 2021};
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Enhance the re-hosting process and evaluate the emulated firmware performance regarding its network capabilities \& Execute vulnerability discovery techniques in the emulated systems.
