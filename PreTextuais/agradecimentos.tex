% MAYBE UM AGRADECIMENTO GERAL
% ======================================================================
First, I would like to thank my mother and my father, who never spared efforts in raising their children. From their dedication I draw my strength and from their tenderness, I draw my inspiration. I would also like to thank my sister, always caring and supportive, and whose achievements have always inspired me.

Next, I would like to thank my girlfriend. Her support and love comforted me and her smile made the bad days easier to overcome. Thanks for the good moments and comprehension.

I would also like to thank all the friends I made along the way, especially my roommates, with whom I shared a lot of good moments, and whose partnership has helped me a lot over the last years.

Finally, I would like to thank all the professors and professionals who were part of my education, especially professor Louren√ßo for the mentoring during this work, and also to the Aeronautics Institute of Technology as a whole. I feel very honored to have had the opportunity to study in this institute, and I hope someday I can repay society the high-quality education it provided me.
