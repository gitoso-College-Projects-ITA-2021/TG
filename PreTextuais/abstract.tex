% OLD ABSTRACT, NEED TO DO A NEW ONE AFTER THE WORK IS DONE

% Studying embedded devices software security is important to help vendors identify software flaws that lead to security vulnerabilities so they can fix them and enhance their devices security. This way, a cybersecurity attack leveraging insecure IoT devices can be avoided. In this preliminary work we describe a way to automate security analysis on wireless routers firmware. Our proposal is to automatically acquire firmware images from vendor websites, extract kernel and filesystem from the acquired images and then re-host the firmware inside an emulator to use known techniques of vulnerability discovery.
